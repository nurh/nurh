### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nur, and I am a freelance developer and tech writer. I've worked for companies such as Grab, Intel, and Motorola. I've written articles on Linux for LWN.net. My interests are research and development of operating systems. If it's a new and interesting OS, I'll be sure to check it out!
